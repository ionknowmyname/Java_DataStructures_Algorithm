Simple Java Chat Application
This is a simple text-based chat application implementing socket programming in Java. It consists of a server that can handle multiple clients and a client application with a text-based interface.
Features

Server handles multiple client connections
Clients can send messages to all other connected clients
Server broadcasts messages to all connected clients
Users are assigned unique IDs
Notification when users join or leave the chat
Simple text-based user interface

Components

ChatServer.java - Implements the server functionality
ChatClient.java - Implements the client functionality

How to Run
Compile the Java files
Copyjavac ChatServer.java
javac ChatClient.java
Start the Server
Copyjava ChatServer
The server will start and display a message indicating it's waiting for clients to connect.
Start the Client(s)
Copyjava ChatClient
You can start multiple instances of the client to simulate multiple users chatting. Each client will be assigned a unique user ID by the server.
Usage

When a client connects, they will receive a welcome message and information about how to exit the chat.
Type messages in the client console and press Enter to send them.
All connected clients will receive the messages sent by other users.
To exit the chat, type /quit and press Enter.

Implementation Details
Server Implementation
The server uses the following key components:

ServerSocket: Used to listen for incoming client connections
Socket: Represents a connection to a client
ClientHandler: A class that handles communication with a single client, implemented as a Runnable to run in a separate thread
ConcurrentHashMap: Stores connected clients with their unique IDs
Broadcast mechanism: Sends messages to all connected clients

Client Implementation
The client uses the following key components:

Socket: Connects to the server
PrintWriter: Sends messages to the server
BufferedReader: Receives messages from the server
Separate threads: One for handling incoming messages and one for handling outgoing messages
